🛠️ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm run dev

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080
 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests
 for more information.

npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment
 for more information.

npm run eject

⚠️ Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you have full control over them.

All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

You don’t ever have to use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments.
